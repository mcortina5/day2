# Write a program that asks the user how many names they have. (If they have a first name, two middle names, and a last name, for example, they would type 4.) Then, using a for loop, ask the user for each of their names. Finally, print their full name.



# problem #2
# Write a program that prints even numbers 2 through 20 using a while loop.
